# The-Configurator
A simple PowerShell application for rack and stack configuration jobs

This application was made to save us the headache of having to make 100+ config files for a rack and stack job in my office, I am not a software developer so it is far from perfect but got the job done for what we needed. If you use this you will have to edit portions of the code to match your specific use case.

To use this application you must have a CSV file which contains the data that you want to have in your configuration
The second file you must have is a .txt file with the template that you want the data from the CSV file to be put into
